		<h2 id="About">DROUGHT</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>A drought is a period of below-average precipitation in a given region, resulting in prolonged shortages in the water supply, whether atmospheric, surface water or ground water. A drought can last for months or years, or may be declared after as few as 15 days.<br/>It can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem and agriculture of the affected region and harm to the local economy.Annual dry seasons in the tropics significantly increase the chances of a drought developing and subsequent bush fires. Periods of heat can significantly worsen drought conditions by hastening evaporation of water vapour.</p>

		<p>Many plant species, such as those in the family Cactaceae (or cacti), have drought tolerance adaptations like reduced leaf area and waxy cuticles to enhance their ability to tolerate drought. Some others survive dry periods as buried seeds. Semi-permanent drought produces arid biomes such as deserts and grasslands.</p>
		<h2 id="Effect">Effect of Drought</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>The effects of drought are widespread and have devastating effects on the environment and the society as a whole. Water use is part and parcel of almost every human activity as well as the life of plants and animals. On this basis, extended deficiency of water can affect the society in various ways both directly and indirectly. The effects can therefore generally be categorized as environmental, economic, and social.</p>
		<ul>
				<li>Drying out of water bodies</li>
				<li>Reduction in soil quality</li>
				<li>Unsuitable conditions for plant and vegetation survival</li>
				<li>Migration and even death of Animals and Wildlife</li>
				<li>Increased budgetary spending by farmers</li>
				<li>Reduced crop yields</li>
				<li>Hunger, anemia, malnutrition, and deaths</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="Prediction">Prediction</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Many international experts and representatives from national meteorological and hydrological services around the world have identified the SPI as a universal meteorological drought index for effective drought monitoring and climate risk management. A simple method has been developed at the NCEP CPC to operationally forecast three month and six month Standardized Precipitation Indices (SPIs) for the prediction of meteorological drought over the contiguous United States. The methodology is based on precipitation (P) seasonal forecasts from the NCEP Climate Forecast System, version 2 (CFSv2). Before predicting SPI, the P forecasts from the coarse resolution CFS global model are corrected for biases and downscaled to higher resolution, based on the probability distribution function method, to a regional grid of 50 km. The downscaled and bias-corrected CFSv2 P forecasts, out to 9 months, are appended to the P analyses to form an extended P data set. The SPIs are then calculated from this new time series. The skill is regionally and seasonally dependent, however overall, the six month SPI is skillful out to three or months.</p>
		<h2 id="Forecasting">Forecasting</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Drought forecasting and monitoring can be defined as data collection, analysis, and reporting to develop information on current and future drought conditions. Observing and understanding current and historical weather, soil, and hydrologic conditions during droughts goes hand-in-hand with predicting future droughts, as these observations are the main inputs for computer models used in drought forecasting.</p>
		<p>Farmers are some of the people most directly impacted by drought and regularly cite having access to seasonal forecasts of the climate as one of their most important tools for making important decisions regarding the management of their crops, livestock, soil, harvest, and equipment. Those responsible for controlling and protecting water bodies - including groundwater and wetlands - rely on drought reports and forecasts in order to adjust their operations, trigger water use restrictions, and shift allocations. Water users and water treatment operators require drought forecasts to respond appropriately to elevated water temperatures and changes to biochemical processes that occur under low moisture conditions.</p>
		<h2 id="Preparedness">Preparedness</h2>
		<hr>
		<p>Drought is considered by many people to be strictly a natural or physical event. This view of drought provides little, if any, opportunity to alter the impact of drought through the application of appropriate drought management techniques. In reality, drought has both physical and social components, and it is essential that water managers and decisionmakers understand
