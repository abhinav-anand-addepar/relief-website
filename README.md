# relief-website
website to  predict, prevent and manage the impact of natural disasters.


What the project does ?

we are making a website which can reduce loss of life in case of a natural disaster by providing information related to prevention and management during a natural disaster . We aim to reduce panic among the people by providing necessary actions to be taken during a
disaster .


Why the project is useful ?

This project has several unique features which makes it useful . Some of them are :-

:There will be an alert tab in the website which will give information about the natural disaster immediately after it takes place. It will also provide necessary actions that should be taken by people affected to reduce loss of life . It will also give location affected and any future precautions so that the people can prepare themselves for the after impact of the natural disaster.
 
:During a natural disaster people can mark themselves as safe\unsafe so that necessary actions can be taken during relief measures .
If anyone is injured in a disaster they could ask for help in the website so that necessary relief could be provided to them as soon as possible .

:There will be a webpage containing several precautions taken so that people can be prepared for any sort of natural disaster .

:The website will be constantly updated to provide the people about the latest information about any crisis .

:During any disaster we aim to start an ALL INDIA CAMPAIGN through this website to provide relief to the victims of the disaster .
